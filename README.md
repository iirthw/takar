# gtest_proto
A prototype (template) repo for a simple project integrated with googletest https://github.com/google/googletest

Setting up a new project with cmake and GTest is known to be a rather cumbersome task (not for everyone though, but definitively for me üêí) due to a relatively large amount of boilerplate cmake code to be added before being able to setup the project.
This template project is created in order to mitigate the aforementioned issue with the boilerplate cmake code, and could be used to get started quickly with a new project.

The project provides the following:
* a simple project structure to bootstrap a new project
* a cmake integration with GTest
